Scenario Mapping Example;

Persona - John G, the Highlands family man with a busy work schedule is looking to book his annual 
family vacation with a small amount of late-evening downtime that he's found on a Friday night. He doesn't
have the time to go to a high street travel agent, hence would like to complete the whole process 
online and at home, in bed with a nice ginger tea. 
He is also aware that, with his schedule, his family is only able to holiday together over the 
Christmas period, and needs to be able to see the best available family-friendly destinations that are 
highly rated for Christmas festivities. They've never had a Christmas abroad as a family, and so John is looking 
to pre-book all their activities quickly and easily using as few websites as possible. He is looking for 
a clean, modern website that is easy to navigate and provides a great, all-encompassing user experience.
